\section{Program Validation and Verification}
\label{ss:progr-valid-verif}

Tell us how you tested the system and why you believe it works.
Describe the Quality Management Plan for your project, that is,
software testing plan. The plan should indicate the types of testing
that was performed and detail how they were done. This must include
the reasons on why the chosen testing protocol was considered
effective.

Create a table that summarizes the testing plan (see Table
\ref{tab:test-plan}).

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
\caption{Summary Testing Plan. A table caption goes above the table.}

\begin{tabular}[t]{|p{8cm}|p{7cm}|} \hline

  \textbf{Process} & \textbf{Technique} \\ \hline 1. Class
    Testing: test methods and state behaviour of classes & Random,
    Partition and White-Box Tests \\ \hline 2. Integration Testing:
    test the
    interaction of sets of classes & Random and Behavioural Testing \\
    \hline 3. Validation Testing: test whether customer requirements
    are satisfied & Use-case based black box and Acceptance tests \\
    \hline 4. System Testing: test the behaviour of the system as part
    of a larger environment & Recovery, security, stress and
    performance tests \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

\label{tab:test-plan}
\end{table}
Describe all the steps taken to validate the correctness of the
program.

If you had user tests then say what you did and what the results
were. Describe why these test data were chosen (what test conditions
the data was testing).  Table \ref{tab:tests} provides an example of
the sorts of results we are looking for. The full detail of the test
runs should be appended to the report.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
\caption{A table of tests. A table caption goes above the table.}

  \begin{tabular}[t]{|p{5.5cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|} \hline \textbf{Data Set
    and reason for its choice} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\textbf{Test Cases}}\\
    \cline{2-4} & \emph{Normal Functioning} & \emph{Extreme boundary cases} &
    \emph{Invalid Data (program should not crash)} \\ \hline Preliminary test
    (see Appendix 3) & Passed & n/a & Fell over \\\hline &&&\\ \hline

  \end{tabular}

\label{tab:tests}
\end{table}

Follow your table of results with a discussions of them highlighting
how useful and usable your system is for its intended purpose.
