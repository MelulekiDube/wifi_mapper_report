\section{Implementation}
Now we get to the details. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe your data structures and be sure to illustrate them
  with a diagram.

\item If your user interface was a key feature describe how that was
  implemented.

\item Discuss the function of the most significant methods in each
  class. This may well require flowcharts, or sequence diagrams, in
  some cases.

\item Any special relationship between the classes (e.g. friends) and
  why they exist.

\item A description of any special programming techniques or libraries
  used.
\end{itemize}
