\subsection{Introduction}
\label{ss:introduction}

Your introduction provides the context for the project and should
contain the statement of the scope of the project (which may have
changed since you first wrote it). Someone reading your introduction
must have clear idea of what the system is intended for. If you think
there is something special about the kind of problem you tackled that
your reader needs to know up front then this is where you say it.

If you need any survey of other work (you probably don't) then put it
towards the end of the introduction and give suitable references. A
case where this is needed is if your project builds on someone else's
project or some published algorithm.

Discuss your approach to solving the problem. Please give a short
overview of the software engineering methods you used (e.g.,
traditional analysis followed by design and implementation -- typically
the case if you did an evolutionary prototype, or a more agile
approach where you had a cyclical development process).
