\section{User Manual}
\label{ss:user-manual}

Your system must have a user manual. Append this to your report (make
it Appendix A) or bind it separately if it is big. If your system is
interactive and has a good user interface with context dependent help
then this can be just a cheat sheet. Discuss the level at which your
user manual is to be pitched with your client. If your system is to be
extended then you might want to include a technical API manual.
